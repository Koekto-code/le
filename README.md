# le
"ls Extended" for Linux
Not so extended in features, but can be extended with -w option! Manually.

# Building
```bash
./install.sh
```
# Usage
```bash
le <directory> -w=120 -d=3 -s=0 # list directory with 3 levels of recursion, don't show hidden files, display names in 120-character field.
le / -d # list everything on PC (of course if it allows to do so =)
```
